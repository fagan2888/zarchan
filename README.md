This contains rough and ready Python implementations of the algorithms in Paul Zarchan's Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering.

They aim to be a reasonably faithful rendition of his code, including the fairly obscure naming convention. However,
I do break things out into functions, etc. I want to be able to read the Python, compare it to the Fortran, and be
able to instantly see the correspondance. I would not write code this way if I was writing it from scratch (bad names,
no functions, tons of duplicated code, and so on).

The only reason for doing this is for me to learn from his book, and to practice rather than just read. If someone
else finds this useful, great, but that is not the point. See my library filterpy for Kalman filtering written for
other users.
